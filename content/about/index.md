# About Me

I’m a 5-12 band director living in eastern Iowa. I’ve been teaching since 2018, and in my previous position, I was teaching general music and 5-8 band.

I like to share thoughts on how I’m using technology in my teaching, I really like tinkering with my workflows (both in my teaching and personal life). My (now-out-of-date) tech set-up is detailed <a href="https://mrehler.wordpress.com/2018/01/10/my-tech-set-up/">here</a>. A brief update to it can be found at [this post](https://mrehler.wordpress.com/2024/01/02/my-default-apps-of-2023/).

I keep too many tabs open all the time on every device. I don’t consider myself a composer, but a music notation software enthusiast. I have a backlog of books that only seems to grow, and when I'm wasting time, it's either watching college football or digging up some nerdy project. I’m a total coffee nut, roasting my own beans and…well <a href="https://mrehler.wordpress.com/2018/01/11/coffee-setup-my-coffee-story/">here’s *that* post</a>.

Links to my social media accounts where I have other content available are in the sidebar and in the header.
