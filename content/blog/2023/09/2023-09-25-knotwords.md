I’ve been meaning to post about a lot of different things and failed to get around to it (including Dorico 5!)

My students often talk about Wordle, and on Mastodon (another topic I’ve meant to post on!) I see discussion about it and other word games. Wordle never clicked for me, but a game that I consider in a similar vein has: Knotwords.

Knotwords is by [Zach Gage](http://stfj.net/), who I already thought made great phone games before Knotwords (his [Good Sudoku](https://www.playgoodsudoku.com/) took me from liking Sudoku to being at least a bit good at it). [Knotwords](http://www.playknotwords.com/) is a word game that is like a crossword puzzle that’s about unscrambling words, rather than solving clues. It’s better played than explained.

Some might say it’s cheating, but I like to play with the ‘Correct Word Feedback’ setting, rather than the default ‘valid.’ Maybe one day, I’ll play it the _real_ way, but for now, I enjoy it with that setting enough to rack up a 474-day streak. It’s available on [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/knotwords/id1598756238) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details) and even [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1963900/Knotwords/). On the former two, you can play the “real” game without paying anything, though you’ll _want_ to pay when you play a bit to really get your fix and develop your muscles with the access to additional puzzles.
