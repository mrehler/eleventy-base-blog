I'm making this site as a means of sharing the materials I've created that others might find useful, and as a means for discussing things important to me.  I'm enjoying learning the ins and outs of Wordpress, and am currently hosting the site through Wordpress.com (as the bottom of the page suggests).  In the future I might move to a different Wordpress host, but from what I've been reading and what my needs are, Wordpress seems to be the right tool for the job.
