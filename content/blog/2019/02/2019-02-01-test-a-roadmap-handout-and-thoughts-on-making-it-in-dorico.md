_tl;dr here’s a link to download the resource_

I wanted to review “roadmap” terminology with my band when we got back from Christmas break this year. The meme for \[“Happy Birthday to Repeat”\](either an imgur link or directly post it to your blog https://i.imgur.com/Gc7f77a.png) has been circulating around every Facebook group I’m on for awhile, so I figured I would edit it[\[1\]](1 "see footnote") for each instrument as part of the resource.

I’ve begun transitioning to doing most of my work in Dorico, and while I traditionally prefer to make a text-heavy resource in a dedicated word processor or desktop publisher, I figured making this entirely in Dorico would be worth a shot, having different music for each instrument.

The key to making this was with Dorico’s master page set feature. I’ve heard that this feature is similar to something in software like InDesign. I found it a bit difficult to wrap my head around not being familiar with it before. There are [many](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9I6qdKJ-zQ&list=PLoyaeouPUsdtQAPZqIiDYPNVCJEczPYaG&index=6 "Official Dorico tutorial from playlist") [great](https://www.scoringnotes.com/tips/working-with-master-pages-in-dorico-part-1/ "Excellent articles by Dan Kreider over on Scoring Notes") [resources](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JcktbP8P3A&feature=youtu.be "One of many /"Discover Dorico/" features") explaining these. I made one master page that contained all of the text in a single frame, and a music frame for the part. I had to fiddle a bit to get the right music frame selected, but ultimately got that part of the layout fine.

Input with Dorico is generally smooth. I didn’t try to make the same project in Sibelius or Finale for comparison, but Dorico forcing barlines on first endings made the printed music a bit clumsier (though it generally makes musical sense).

The first two parts (laying out the pages frames and putting in the actual music) were pretty satisfactory. I began to feel some real limitations with Dorico at present with trying to fix the layout of the music itself, and processing each additional part.

First off, each bit of friction I ran into would have been lessened if there were some way to copy layouts between parts. Sibelius has a feature that does this easily. It also meant that I wasn’t terribly consistent across different parts.

For each part, I had to start by applying the master page I’d created (which may have been alleviated if I’d made the changes to the “First” master page rather than making a new master page), then putting in the same system breaks. Then I’d need to switch in to note spacing[\[2\]](2 "see footnote") mode and adjust the end of the second system, and the beginning and end of the third system. Note spacing is done exclusively with the arrow keys, rather than by dragging, which (even with the ⌘+arrow key shortcut to make bigger movements) feels like it takes forever, even if it’s not much slower than dragging. Then it’s a switch back to graphic editing mode to adjust a few more elements that aren’t worth moving until the systems are in the proper place (like the D.C. al Coda and the Fine not reading like one instruction). Then do it all over again for the next instrument.

Here’s a link to the resource, containing parts for flute, clarinet, alto sax, bari sax, trumpet, trombone, tuba, and xylophone. Normally, when making something like this, I’d make it for all of the standard instruments in the concert band ensemble. The high friction of adjusting each part, however, stopped me short. I’ll probably get back to it and finish it for the remaining parts after the school year. In the mean time, the Dorico file itself will be up there if anyone wants to put themselves through the fun I just described for any parts they need. Don’t have Dorico? There’s a free 30-day trial.

Despite my griping[\[3\]](3 "see footnote") I really like Dorico and I’m glad to be using it as my primary driver. While I have my share of complaints about its shortcomings as of January 2019, I have a lot of accolades to sing. I may have a proper collection of all the things I appreciate about it, and attempt to catalog all the outstanding complaints that I have. Like an unsolicited review. I haven’t exactly been cranking out the posts though. If you want to try and get an accurate picture of why Dorico can be so exciting, the absolute best place to go is to the Scoring Notes blog to go through the [reviews of Dorico](https://www.scoringnotes.com/news/dorico-is-here-a-review/) starting with v1.0. As they’ve delved into each new feature, they’ve managed to highlight how well Dorico implements it.

2. I wasn’t looking very carefully when I made this decision to the actual metering of the bars. In my head I was originally only going to transpose it to B♭ and put it in the right range for everyone. In theory, the metering works. It’s pretty straightforward until the coda. If you try and conduct through it, you need to treat the first quarter note of the coda as one, which the pickup bar would indicate, and then everything else line up fine.  [↩](1 "return to article")

4. There’s no default shortcuts for switching between the different tools in Engraving mode, which is frustrating. I haven’t been using Dorico enough to figure out what keys are unbound and come up with my own shortcuts for things such as this. While Dorico makes it easy to bind new shortcuts for most things, the number of things that have no default shortcut is high, and I personally don’t care for it as a design choice. I don’t feel confident in making my own shortcuts at this point with Dorico when so many new features are due to come along that will hopefully have their own shortcuts.  [↩](2 "return to article")

6. I read all the time on Apple blogs that the people who love the software the most have the most to say about how it should be better. Don’t mistake this for constructive criticism, it’s definitely bellyaching. I write it though because I do love Dorico.  [↩](3 "return to article")
