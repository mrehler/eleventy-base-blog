[MarsEdit 5](https://redsweater.com/marsedit/) is out, and I continue to be happy to use it. One of the new features in it is called "Micropost" which is great for people who use a service like [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog). Ostensibly, it can make it more "frictionless" to post, encouraging more frequent posting. It will not, however, help me to post more. As I am able to demonstrate in this very post, the root cause of me not posting more than I do is not how difficult it is to post, but that I feel the need to establish more context than is (maybe) really necessary in order to have a post feel "finished."
